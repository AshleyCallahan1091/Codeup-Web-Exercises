		<h1>National Parks</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt>Can I bring a gun to Yellowstone National Park?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, guns are permitted in Yellowstone National Park.</dd>

			<dt>Can I shoot my gun?</dt>
			<dd>No. This isn't Texas</dd>

			<dt>If I can't shoot my gun, why are they allowed?</dt>
			<dd>For hunting purposes and travel outside the park, between small towns. Check state gun laws, as leaving the park can put you in one of three states.</dd>

			<dt>Can I bring my pet to Yellowstone National Park?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, if you want to only see the inside of your tent and the surrounding 100 feet of roads and the front area of the park. It's best to either leave them at home or in a kennel. Or find a different park to visit.</dd>

			<dt>Do cell phones work in Yellowstone National Park?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, but did you really come here just to be on your cell phone?</dd>

			<dt>Can I pet the animals?</dt>
			<dd>Yes but it's up to your family to arrange your closed-casket funeral.</dd>

			<dt>Can I feed the animals?</dt>
			<dd>See above answer.</dd>

			<dt>How much does Yellowstone cost?</dt>
			<dd>Probably enough to pay for your closed casket funeral but we still won't.</dd>

			<dt>Can I drink alcohol in a state park?</dt>
			<dd>Not in Texas. Too many drunken cactus adventures.</dd>

			<dt>How can I avoid heat stress?</dt>
			<dd>Air conditioning.</dd>

		<h3 class="randomAssParksToggle"> Zion National Park</h3>
		<ul class="randomAssParks">
			<li>Zion National Park has hiking trails that range from 30 minutes to four hours and range from beginning to experienced hiking skills. If it's your first time ever hiking, maybe you should just stick to the hipster rockwalls downtown.</li>
			<li>Only experienced climbers should attempt climbing the sandstone cliffs and should only go from March-May or September-November because they'll get melted by the sun (not really but you'll look like a leathered lobster when you're done).</li>
			<li>If you like horseback-riding and aren't afraid of a huge animal possibly throwing you off its back and trampling you when it gets spooked by a squirrel, feel free to schedule a horseback tour.</li>
			<li>Canyoneering is a real activity that combines finding routes, rappelling, swimming, hiking and other things that will get you killed in places where rangers won't find you until dental records are needed in order to track down your worried-sick mother. Why would you do that to her? Stay safe. Play Firewatch instead.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<h3 class="randomAssParksToggle">Yellowstone National Park</h3>
		<ul class="randomAssParks">
			<li>Annual precipitation ranges from 10 inches at the north boundary to 80 inches in the southwest corner. So basically it goes from Texas rain levels normally to Texas rain levels in May 2016.</li>
			<li>Yellowstone has an active volcano. Seriously, why would you even come here?</li>
			<li>There are 290 waterfalls in Yellowstone. The only reasonable time to even consider jumping from a waterfall is if an Androminous-Rex is chasing you.</li>
			<li>There are 67 species of mammals, all of which you should avoid.</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<h3 class="randomAssParksToggle">Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
		<ul class="randomAssParks">
			<li>The Grand Canyon is a chasm 277 miles long and up to 18 miles wide. Don't fall. No one will find you.</li>
			<li>It is illegal to refuse a person a glass of water. Just think. A bartender at some backass saloon denied a man (because a woman would have brought sufficient water) a glass of water and he died of a heatstroke. I bet that bartender felt mighty guilty after that. Probably even paid for that guy's funeral.</li>
			<li>It is also illegal to keep a donkey in your bathtub. I can't imagine why you would want to but if that's the only way your donkey will take a bath, maybe you should rethink living in Arizona.</li>
			<li>Grand Canyon includes approximately 70 species of mammals, 250 species of birds, 25 types of reptiles and 5 species of amphibians. Avoid each and every one of them. They will eat you for sport. Okay, maybe not, but seriously. Common sense. Don't pet them, put them in your rocket or try to domesticate them and train them to eat from your hand. They'll get fat and follow you home. And then eat you.</li>
